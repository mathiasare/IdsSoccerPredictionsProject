# Repository for Data Science(LTAT.02.002) course project

## Group C14

## Members: Mathias Are, Hans Matthias Andreas

### Welcome to our project repository!

 In this Python ML project we use European Soccer Database from KAGGLE to build two machine learning models:
    * Model A : uses data about individual players
    * Model B : uses data about team attributes

Player and team attributes are originally from EA FIFA video games


More detailed information can be found in the project report PDF file : C14_report.pdf


## Notebook guide:

Data exploration notebook (dataExploration.ipynb in data_mining folder): Uses pandas dataframe methods to explore the data for both models

Data Preparation Notebook Model 1 (dataPreparationM1.ipynb in data_mining folder): Uses pandas dataframe methods to extract the necessary data for **Model A** into a single dataframe and saves it as a csv file.

Data Preparation Notebook Model 2 (dataPrepM2.ipynb in data_mining folder): Same as previous for **Model B**.

Model Training notebook for Model A (train_model_A.ipynb in training folder): notebook for training **Model A** using prepared data from Data Preparation Notebook Model 1 notebook.

Model Training notebook for Model B (train_model_A.ipynb in training folder): Same as previous for **Model B**.

Compare models notebook (compare_models.ipynb) : Trains the two models and compares them using matplotlib plots.
